Currently solved equation:

                       1 / gamma_c
  (x_c ⋅ temperature_c)            ⋅ (contrast − brightness_c) + brightness_c = y_c,

  0 ≤ temperature_c ≤ 1, ∃ i : temperature_i = 1,
  gamma_c > 0

But we also need brilliance:

                                    1 / gamma_c
  (x_c ⋅ brilliance ⋅ temperature_c)            ⋅ (contrast − brightness_c) + brightness_c = y_c,
  
  0 ≤ temperature_c ≤ 1, ∃ i : temperature_i = 1,
  gamma_c > 0,
  0 ≤ brilliance ≤ 1
