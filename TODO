Currently solved equation:

                       1 / gamma_c
  (x_c ⋅ temperature_c)            ⋅ (contrast − brightness_c) + brightness_c = y_c,

  0 ≤ temperature_c ≤ 1, ∃ i : temperature_i = 1,
  gamma_c > 0

But we also need brilliance:

                                    1 / gamma_c
  (x_c ⋅ brilliance ⋅ temperature_c)            ⋅ (contrast − brightness_c) + brightness_c = y_c,
  
  0 ≤ temperature_c ≤ 1, ∃ i : temperature_i = 1,
  gamma_c > 0,
  0 ≤ brilliance ≤ 1


It should be possible to give hints. For example:
*  All channels have the same contrast/brightness/gamma
*  The colour temperature is 6500 K
*  The gamma/contrast is 1:1:1
*  The brightness is 1:1:1
*  The brilliance is 1
